# Custom Bots

Get more customization with your own custom bot running Beep Boop, you can name it whatever you want, put on whatever avatar you want, it's your bot.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disclaimer: Your custom bot won't get a verified check. Why? Since it's only in a small amount of servers Discord won't verify your bot.

{% endhint %}

## Setting up your custom bot

First off, head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create a new application. You can always change this later.

After you finish creating your bot's application you can customize your bot, with your own avatar and username. Once you're all done customizing your bot's application you can create a bot user for your app. Go to Bot and click Create Bot.

### IMPORTANT: Enable Privileged Gateway Intents

For your custom bot to work, you'll need to enable Privileged Gateway Intents. This allows us to listen to certain events.

### Setting up your custom bot on Beep Boop

Head back onto Discord, go to the server you want your bot to primarily be, and use `/subscription`, you should see a few buttons and your information about your subscription.

Once you've finished looking around, click on `Custom Branding` and click new bot and a modal will show up, like this one:

Generate a token from your bot's Discord Developer Portal page and enter it in the Bot Token field and your bot should come online in a few seconds.
